# doomfx-vst
DoomFX is a VST3 multi-effects audio plugin designed to produce Doomer-style mixes. The plugin will provide a modular effects chain, analog-inspired signal processing, and a themed UI. It must support cross-platform compatibility, especially for GNU/Linux users, and operate within major DAWs.
