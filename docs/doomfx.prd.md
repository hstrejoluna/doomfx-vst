## **Product Name**

**DoomFX** ‚Äì VST3 Plugin for Doomer Mix Effects

---

## **Overview**

**DoomFX** is a VST3 audio plugin designed to help producers craft emotionally immersive "Doomer-style" mixes using a powerful chain of analog-inspired effects. The plugin provides modular control over effects like reverb, saturation, lo-fi filters, and stereo widening. Aesthetically, it draws from post-Soviet grit, 80s analog hardware, and lo-fi urban decay.

This document outlines the MVP requirements to deliver a functional, cross-platform plugin for musicians, sound designers, and hobbyists seeking that nostalgic, melancholic sound.
